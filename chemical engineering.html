<p>Welcome to the Department of Chemical Engineering, a hub of innovation and transformation since 1964. The department offers a diverse array of academic programs, including B.Tech., M.Tech., and Ph.D., designed to meet industry demands and attract top talent. Our accomplished faculty, blending experience and youth, excel in teaching and groundbreaking research. The laboratories equipped with state-of-the-art facilities support experiential learning and industry-aligned curriculum.

We bridge theory and practice through research initiatives and collaborations with leading industries. Our alumni hold key positions globally, reflecting our commitment to shaping influential leaders. We've reached milestones like our Golden Jubilee in 2014â€“15 and hosted renowned international conferences. The department garnered accolades over the years, including a prestigious 5-year accreditation from the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) for the B.Tech. program in 2015, subsequently another 6-year accreditation in 2022, affirming our dedication to excellence. Our M.Tech. program also earned a similar 5-year accreditation in 2016, emphasizing our commitment to providing world-class education.

The department has evolved from an initial intake of 30 students to the current capacity of 126 in B.Tech, with dynamic specializations in tune with industry trends in M.Tech and a well-funded PhD program. We support PMRF fellowships, QIP, industry-sponsored PhD scholars, and post-doctoral fellows. Our state-of-the-art building, complete with green ambience and aesthetic landscaping, stands as a symbol of architectural elegance.

Welcome to the world of chemical engineering, where intellectual rigor, experiential learning, and industry engagement come together. Join us as we push the boundaries of what's possible and continue redefining the art and science of chemical engineering.</p>
