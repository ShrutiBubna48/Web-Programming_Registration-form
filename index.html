I am glad that I have been given an opportunity to serve as the Director of National 
Institute of Technology (NIT) Warangal-the oldest one in the bracket of first 17 NITs.
 It is an honour and privilege for me to lead this prestigious institute which has a
 rich history of its distinction in teaching, research and service to the nation.
 It is the first regional engineering college whose foundation stone has been laid
 by the former prime minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in the year 1959. Over a
 period of more than six decades, NIT Warangal has emerged as one of the leading
 institutions in engineering and technology. Warangal is the second largest city
 of the state of Telangana, Hyderabad being the first one which has several places
 of interest to visit. Some of the cultural heritages worth seeing in Warangal are
 Ramappa Temple, Bhadrakali Temple and thousand pillar temple. NIT Warangal is poised 
to create an ambience for nurturing innovation, incubation, creativity and excellence 
within its faculty and students towards achieving the sustainable development goals. 
We emphasize on student centric education with interdisciplinary research and development
 for the benefit of Industry and Society.NIT Warangal becomes a preferred institution for
 top rankers in Joint Entrance Examination (Main) because of its excellent teaching
 learning process, infrastructure that a student needs for effective learning. Our
 alumni have received distinguished recognitions in their chosen areas of profession 
and extend support towards sustainable development of the institute. I invite participation
 of all the stakeholders in the growth plan of the institute to steer it to the next level 
of success in all fronts.
